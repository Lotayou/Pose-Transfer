# Dataset: Adding FUNIT class label (Is it really necessary to set each person as a class?)
# Model: For training stage, just append ground truth as class image

# Model: Integrating PATN and FUNIT models together, forward, backward and updating(not tested)
    @ TODO: pay attention if FUNIT need square input, and padding zeros if necessary
    @ TODO: implementing saving and logging utils.
    @ TODO: Testing.

20191002:
# Saving and logging utils complete.
# Square padding check: FUNIT network performs 4 downsampling at most, leading to 16* spatial scaling.
    Current input (256, 176) should be fine. Wait until runtime-check.
# Training scheme I: Fix patn, scheduling on FUNIT only. Start training ASAP.


Work to do:
# Using A for class reference, or use more than one image? Try both case and perform ablation study.
# Implementing scheduler mechanism for funit and patn: fix PATN and updating FUNIT for K epochs,
    then set PATN learning rate to 1/10 of FUNIT and continue for another K epochs (K=30?)
