# Creating new dataset with bundled reference image of the same person.
# Creating two stage model backbone and I/O interface.

# Dataset: Adding FUNIT class label (Is it really necessary to set each person as a class?)
# Model: For training stage, just append ground truth as class image

# Model: Integrating PATN and FUNIT models together, forward, backward and updating(not tested)
    @ TODO: pay attention if FUNIT need square input, and padding zeros if necessary
    @ TODO: implementing saving and logging utils.
    @ TODO: Testing.

20191002:
# Saving and logging utils complete.
# Square padding check: FUNIT network performs 4 downsampling at most, leading to 16* spatial scaling.
    Current input (256, 176) should be fine. Wait until runtime-check.
# Training scheme I: Fix patn, scheduling on FUNIT only. Start training ASAP.

20191003:
# Start testing the integreated framework.
    # Critical bug fix: In FUNIT_module/blocks.py, set inplace=False for ReLU and LeakyReLU, otherwise some variables that require gradients would be modified in-place during back-propagation, leading to RuntimeError.

# Start training

Work to do:
# Implementing testing script.
    # Dealing with Ys bundle, align dimension 0. (k=3?)
# Using A for class reference, or use more than one image? Try both case and perform ablation study.
# Implementing scheduler mechanism for funit and patn: fix PATN and updating FUNIT for K epochs,
    then set PATN learning rate to 1/10 of FUNIT and continue for another K epochs (K=30?)
# Attach with other pose-guided image generation framework (deformable GAN)?
