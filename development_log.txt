Current Progress:
# Creating new dataset with bundled reference image of the same person.
# Creating two stage model backbone and I/O interface.

Work to do:
# Dataset: Check FUNIT network design to see if it accept target class images with varying length. 
	If not, designating K=3 and drop all batches with less than 3 reference images (modify __getitem__).

# Model: Write forward and backward functions. Pay attention to the input size
	PATN truncates left and right edges by default, leading to an output
	of size (256*176*3), pay attention if FUNIT need square input, and 
	padding zeros if necessary.

# Loss Function: Using recon + GAN + FM for now.

# Scheduler: fix PATN and updating FUNIT for K epochs, then set PATN learning rate to 1/10 of FUNIT and 
	continue for another K epochs (K=30?)
